# Deepfake Detection System 🎭🔍

A powerful AI/ML-based Deepfake Detection System designed to identify manipulated face-swap videos using deep learning. This project is built using a ResNeXt + LSTM architecture for video classification and is integrated with a Node.js backend for real-time inference and deployment.

## 💡 Overview

With the rise of AI-generated media, especially face-swapped deepfake videos, ensuring digital media authenticity has become crucial. Our system aims to detect such videos and flag manipulated content using advanced video processing techniques and deep learning.
